reCAPTCHA Support
===============

    Integrated in WCF 2.0

This plugin replaces the original WoltLab Community Framework captcha with the popular reCAPTCHA.

Notes
-----

The language that is used by reCAPTCHA is detected automatically from the language used in the forum. If the language is not supported by reCAPTCHA (see http://code.google.com/intl/de-DE/apis/recaptcha/docs/customization.html), English is used as a fallback. You can choose between the different reCAPTCHA designs in the ACP under "System » Options » Security » Captcha". You should also add some own public and private keys in the ACP. You can get your own keys for free at https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin/create.
